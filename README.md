# Task Manager App (Interview Assignment)

A Vue.js-based task management app that allows you to create, edit, and manage tasks with local storage support.

## Prerequisites

Before running the project, ensure you have the following installed on your machine:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (>= 22.x.x)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (>10.x.x)

## Getting Started
Clone the project and run:

npm install

## Run the application:

npm run dev

## Open the built development server in your browser:

http://localhost:xxxx/


## About the application

To test all features, go to My Tasks and Add a few new tasks by filling all the data.

## Dashboard

First card shows the most recent 5 tasks you've created.
The second card shows the 5 most urgent tasks with a due date closest to today.
The third card is a representation of your tasks (completed, in progress, upcoming).
The fourth card shows only the tasks which have a due date as the one you've selected in the datepicker.

Each task can be marked as complete with a quick click on any of the icons in the cards (In progress and Upcoming icons).

## My Tasks

A datatable of all your tasks. You can Add, delete or view your tasks. Sortable by all columns.

## Technologies Used

Primevue for components,
Scss for basic color schemes,
tailwind for utility & responsiveness.

## Thoughts

Overall it was a good practice. There are plenty of things I would like to refactor, but this is how far I
could get for a day and a half. Thank you for reaching out.
